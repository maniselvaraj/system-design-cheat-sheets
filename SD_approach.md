# How to approach a System Design Problem?


1. Be curious and question the ask like an end user (or admin)
    1. What is important for the user?
    2. How would the user use the system? What is the workflow?
    3. What is unknown to you (solutions architect)? Ask it out.
2. Question thoroughly to reduce scope.
	1. Do not design a system that susprises the client. They expect a certain solution (esp in an interview)
3. Is this a breadth or depth oriented problem? Design uber vs distributed cache
4. Is this a read or write heavy application?
5. Are there real-time needs? Many applications are real-time now.
